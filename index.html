        <h2>About Us</h2>
       <p> Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)

        Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) is one of the most popular franchises in the Indian Premier League (IPL), known for its vibrant fan base and star-studded lineup. Established in 2008, RCB represents the city of Bangalore, Karnataka, and plays its home matches at the iconic M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
        
        Despite being one of the most entertaining teams in the IPL, RCB is famously known for its pursuit of an IPL title, which has eluded them so far. The team has reached the finals three times (2009, 2011, 2016) and has consistently showcased thrilling performances.
        
        RCB has been home to some of the greatest cricketers, including Virat Kohli, one of the highest run-scorers in IPL history, and legendary players like AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle, whose explosive batting has created unforgettable memories for fans.
        
        The teamâ€™s motto, "Play Bold," perfectly reflects their fearless and aggressive approach to the game. Beyond cricket, RCB actively engages with its fans through campaigns like "Ee Sala Cup Namde" and contributes to social causes, earning respect both on and off the field.
        
        With a loyal fan following called the "RCBians," the Royal Challengers Bangalore remains a powerhouse of talent, passion, and excitement in the world of cricket.
